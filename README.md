# Dotfiles Wolfgang Ederer

This repo holds all my dotfiles. Things I do not want to share reside in private repositories which are linked as submodules.

[Gnu Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is used to make linking the dotfiles a breeze.

### Steps to install dotfiles:
1. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles
2. cd into ~/.dotfiles
3. run stow <folder> to symlink dotfiles
